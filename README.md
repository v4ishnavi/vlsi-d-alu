# vlsi-d-alu
This is my VLSID project from the 1st semester of 2nd year in my college. The project requires us to build an ALU in verilog, ngspice and magic. 
This ALU contains: 
- A four bit adder
- A four bit subtracter
- A four bit comparator
- A four bit AND logic operator

The verilog folder contains the ALU built in Verilog. This is to visualize the logical flow of the circuit.
Then, using ngspice we can see how we can use transistors to build our ALU. this is in the ngspice folder. 
Finally, the magic folder contains the magic files and the extracted ngspice associated with it. We also perform delay analysis to get maximum delay. 

The magic ALU circuit is near perfect, but throws an error while comparing 9 and 11.
